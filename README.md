                                       🌀 PowerShell Version of the Good USB-HDD Sorter Script (v0.01a)
🛠️ Description

This is the PowerShell version of a USB-HDD sorter script that I created with some help from ChatGPT. It automates the process of organizing files into proper directories based on their types (e.g., music, videos, images) and ensures your drive remains clean and organized.

📂 Folder Creation

The script starts by creating a set of directories where the sorted files will be stored. It checks if each folder already exists using Test-Path. If not, it creates the necessary folders using New-Item, ensuring that the directory structure is ready before sorting the files.

📑 Move Files

The core function of the script is Move-Files. Here’s what it does:

Accepts a list of file extensions ($extensions).
Defines a target folder ($destination).
Uses Get-ChildItem to search for files with the matching extensions and moves them to the respective folder.
📁 File Types Organized
The script efficiently organizes various types of files into specific folders:

🎶 Music: .mp3, .flac, .wav, etc.
🎥 Videos: .mp4, .avi, .mkv, etc.
🖼️ Images: .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.
📄 Documents: .pdf, .docx, .txt, etc.
🖥️ Applications & Scripts: .exe, .sh, .bat, etc.
🗜️ Archives: .zip, .rar, .7z, etc.
🗂️ Handling Remaining Files
Any files that don’t match the predefined extensions are moved to a catch-all folder called other_shit. This ensures that no files are left behind, even if they don’t fit into any of the major categories.

🚀 How to Run the Script in PowerShell
Follow these simple steps to run the script on your Windows machine:

Save the script as organize_files.ps1.
Open PowerShell as an Administrator.
Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:

powershell

Copy code
cd C:\path\to\your\script
Run the script with the following command:
powershell

Copy code
./organize_files.ps1
⚡ Performance Considerations for Windows
NTFS: Since the script is optimized for Windows (with native support for NTFS), there’s no need to worry about performance issues related to the filesystem. NTFS handles large numbers of files effectively.

Multithreading: Although PowerShell doesn’t natively support multithreading like GNU Parallel, this script should be fast enough for most users. Advanced users can explore:

Start-Job for running background jobs.
PowerShell 7's ForEach-Object -Parallel for parallel processing, though this adds some complexity.
